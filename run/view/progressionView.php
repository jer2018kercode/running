<p>Becoming a better runner means transforming your body slowly over time to handle more running at faster speeds. It sounds intimidating – but anyone can do it. Even couch potatoes can run dramatically faster than they ever thought, provided they follow the surprisingly simple principles of progression.
Most runners don’t follow a good progression – they do almost the same training all the time and their performances flat-line for years. They ask, “I’ve run the same marathon time for the last three years – can I really improve?” The answer is almost always yes, because the principle of progression is usually not being followed.
If you’re progressing properly – week to week, month to month, and year to year – you’ll avoid burnout and keep your training fresh. You’ll always be energized to run.
There needs to be a shift in how runners approach their training in order to realize their potential. One aspect of that shift is perspective – the perspective of long-term training and being patient. After all, success doesn’t happen overnight.
To help illustrate how progression works – especially in the long-term – I thought drawing some (incredibly artistic) graphs would be helpful.</p>
